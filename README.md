# Reposearch

## Instructions:
1. Create a simple application that utilizes APIs on a fully responsive and cross browser compatible web page using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
2. from a fork of this exact same repo, send a link to your work. (if you dont have a github account, it has to be created)

## Functional Requirements:
1. Users should be able to search for any public repository on github by name and display relevant information such as url, description, number of forks, number of stars and open issues.
2. open issues count should be clickable to display a different page with a table of all the open issues
3. clicking on an open issue should open a different page with all the information necessary
Bonus: create a visualization chart to display the records (preferrably animated)

## Rules/Pointers:
- there is no time limit. you can polish the application as you see fit before submitting.
- Any framework / libraries can be used to accomplish the task
- completed exam should be pushed through github on a public repo 

## Key Factors fo consider:
- clearly written code is a bit plus
- use best practices to write code
- present the app in the best design possible
- we'll be looking at how you commit code.
